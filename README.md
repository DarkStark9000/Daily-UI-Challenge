# Daily UI Challenge
### Hi I am Debarshi Das. At the time of writing, I am a student of Vellore Institute of Technology.
- I am undertaking this challenge with a goal to improve my UI designing skills.
- I signed up  for the challenge on [DailyUI.co](https://www.dailyui.co/). But apparently, the site doesnt seem to be functioning as of 1st Feb, 2022.
- So I am using the challenges' list found in [Pustur's Repo](https://gist.github.com/Pustur/3b2bee790d2c8a966136d76a9157d5e4).
- The exported design will be on my [Dribbble 🏀](https://dribbble.com/DarkStark9000). And if I feel like coding it, I will link my [Codepen ✒](https://codepen.io/darkstark9000) link here.
